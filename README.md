# Frontend JavaScript Learning

This is a learning project for understanding **TypeScript**, **interfaces**, and **web development basics**.

## What's Inside?

### 0x04-TypeScript/

This folder contains TypeScript exercises to learn how to write type-safe JavaScript.

#### task_0 - Student Table

**What we learn:**
- Create an **interface** (a blueprint for objects)
- Create objects that follow the interface
- Render HTML tables with JavaScript
- Use Webpack to bundle TypeScript code

**What it does:**
- Defines a `Student` interface with properties like `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and `location`
- Creates two student objects
- Displays them in an HTML table

**How to run:**
```bash
cd 0x04-TypeScript/task_0
npm install
npx webpack
# Open index.html in your browser
```

**Result:** You'll see a table with student names and locations.
